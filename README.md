# Animation Celebration of Terra Data!
The Orbit Animators are a group of five enthusiastic diploma students passionate about turning science into stories. For NASA’s Terra satellite 25th anniversary, we are exploring how to combine data, design, and creativity to build animations that bring Earth science to life.

We are learners at heart, building skills in data analysis, visualization, web technologies, and storytelling. What makes us stand out is our drive to make complex datasets accessible and engaging — transforming raw information into visuals that spark curiosity and awareness.
